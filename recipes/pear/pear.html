    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>These red pears taste better than anything you've ever had before</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups red wine</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
            <li>4 whole cloves</li>
            <li>1 strip orange zest</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fennel seed (Optional)</li>
            <li>3 whole black peppercorns (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves (Optional)</li>
            <li>6 large firm pears</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the red wine, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, orange zest, fennel seed, peppercorns, and bay leaves in a large saucepan. Peel the pears, and remove the cores from the bottom, leaving the stems intact; set aside. Bring the wine to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Add the pears, return to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue simmering until tender, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pears from the wine syrup, cover, and refrigerate until cold. Strain the syrup through a mesh sieve, and discard the spices. Simmer the syrup over medium heat until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Refrigerate the syrup until cold.</li>
            <li>Once the syrup is cold, pour over the pears, cover, and chill at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
        </ol>
